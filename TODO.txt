    - (Argon) Multiple teams in LE planner  https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1146809197023997975/1178673694869049445
 
Ideas: 

- (Somberlord) Evolution idea : being able to share your roster with people. Unique, or generated link that bring to a static page similar to "Who you Own"

- (Catch) it would be useful to build multiple teams per track. 
    In the Vitruvius LE for example I'm planning to use a team for the first few levels and then change to different teams for the higher levels. 
    It would be great if I could pick out and save these ahead of time so that I could easily see how I'm going to progress.
