description: Refactor or rebuild an existing page to match the current design system. Use when the user says "refactor", "redesign", "update to new style", "migrate to tokens", or points at a page that looks like it was written in 2021.

---

You are fixing a page in **Tacticus Planner** that doesn't match the design system. The user has asked: **$ARGUMENTS**

---

## Find the file first

If a full path wasn't given, find it:
```
Glob: src/fsd/1-pages/**/{name}.tsx
```

If you get multiple matches, ask. Don't pick one and hope for the best.

Also check if `rebuild` appears in `$ARGUMENTS`. If yes: full JSX rewrite, logic untouched. If no: targeted in-place edits.

---

## Read before you touch anything

All of these. In parallel.

```
Read: .claude/skills/build-page/conventions.md
Read: src/fsd/1-pages/ui-kit/ui-kit.page.tsx
Read: {target file}
```

You do not get to skim. Read the whole target file. Understand what it does, what state it manages, what store fields it uses, what the event handlers do. You are not allowed to break any of that.

---

## Audit — write this out before making a single edit

Go through the file and list every violation. Be specific — file and approximate line, not just "there are hardcoded colors".

### Colors (fix all of them, no mercy)
- `bg-blue-*`, `bg-white`, `bg-gray-*`, `bg-slate-*` → token equivalents
- `text-gray-*`, `text-slate-*`, `text-black`, `text-white` → token equivalents  
- `border-slate-*`, `border-gray-*` → `border-(--border)`
- `dark:bg-*` / `dark:text-*` manual dark variants → delete them, tokens handle dark mode
- `style={{ color: '...' }}`, `style={{ background: '...' }}` → className with token
- `hover:bg-(--secondary)` on buttons inside cards/tables → invisible in dark mode (`--secondary` = card surface). Use `hover:bg-(--primary)/15` for neutral actions, `hover:bg-(--danger)/10` for destructive
- Map: white→`--bg`, zinc-950→`--fg`, zinc-600→`--muted-fg`, zinc-200→`--border`, zinc-300→`--input`, indigo→`--primary`, zinc-100→`--secondary`

### Components (replace where a shared component exists)
- Raw `<button>` as a real action → `<Button>` from `@/fsd/5-shared/ui`
- MUI `TextField` / raw `<input>` → `<TextField>` from `@/fsd/5-shared/ui`
- MUI `Switch` → `<Switch>` from `@/fsd/5-shared/ui/switch`
- MUI `Chip` for filters → token-aware chip pattern (see conventions.md)
- MUI `Menu` + `MenuItem` for a dropdown → headlessUI `Listbox` with token styles
- MUI `Tooltip` → `<AccessibleTooltip>` or `<LazyTooltip>`
- MUI `Card` → `<Card>` from `@/fsd/5-shared/ui/card`
- MUI `Divider` → `<Separator>`
- MUI `CircularProgress` / `LinearProgress` → `<Loader>` or the token ProgressBar pattern
- Raw `<select>` for rarity / rank / stars / faction → the domain select components

### Layout (fix what you see)
- Filter toggles and chips crammed on the same row → split: controls in header, values in body
- Clear button rendered conditionally → always render it, `isDisabled={!hasFilters}`
- No page heading → add `<h2>` + `<p className="text-sm text-(--muted-fg)">`
- Section labels styled inconsistently → `text-xs font-bold tracking-widest uppercase text-(--muted-fg)`
- `margin` / `padding` inline styles for spacing → `space-y-*`, `gap-*`

### Typography
- `style={{ fontSize: '...' }}` → use the scale from conventions.md
- `style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}` → `font-semibold`

If the audit comes back clean, tell the user and stop. Don't invent problems.

## Apply the changes

**Targeted refactor:** Use `Edit`. Work in passes — imports first, then colors, then component swaps, then layout. One logical group at a time so the diff stays readable.

**Full rebuild:** Extract every piece of logic (state declarations, useMemo, useContext, handlers, computed values) and copy it verbatim to the top of the new file. Then rewrite only the JSX from scratch. Use `Write` to replace the file. The logic must be byte-for-byte identical — you are not "improving" the algorithm, you are fixing the UI.

**The rule that isn't negotiable:** Do not change business logic. Do not rename variables. Do not refactor handlers. Do not "clean up" useMemo dependencies. You were asked to fix the visuals. Fix the visuals.

---

## Fix your imports

After swapping components, the import list will be wrong. Fix it:
- Remove MUI imports for anything you replaced
- Add the shared component imports you used
- Don't leave unused imports — TypeScript will yell and you'll deserve it

---

## TypeScript check — run it, fix it, then run it again

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep "error" | head -30
```

Common traps you will fall into:
- You removed a MUI import that was also providing a type — find where the type is now needed and fix the import
- `Button` uses `onPress`, not `onClick` — react-aria, not HTML
- `Switch` uses `isSelected`, not `checked` or `value`
- `RaritySelect2` / `RankSelect2` / `StarsSelect2` want `Rarity` / `Rank` / `RarityStars` typed values, not raw `number`

Do not report done until TypeScript is clean.

---

## Tell the user what happened

1. Paste the audit list you produced — what was wrong and where
2. Confirm what you changed
3. Call out anything you could not migrate cleanly — missing component equivalent, too risky to touch, needs a separate decision
4. TypeScript result
