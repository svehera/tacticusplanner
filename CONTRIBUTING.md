# Contributing

Please message on the [Discord#contribute Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1183885004850331788) to join the team.
We'll help you get started there but here are the most important bits.

## Project Planning

We use a combination of Discord and a Trello board for planning what's going on.
The Trello board is managed by Redwyne.
Link here: https://trello.com/b/VA20QPHI/tacticus-planner

## Project Status

`Severyn` originally created the project but has since stepped back for personal reasons.
Control was handed off to `cpunerd` (a.k.a. Kharnage, GitHub name @unrstuart).

## Project Architecture

A lot of the project was migrated by `Severyn` to use [FSD Architecture - Feature Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/).
This is an architecture that splits code by feature and avoids having much cross boundaries between features.
There's also a `src/v2` directory that's actually older than the `src/fsd` stuff.
Unfortunately `Severyn` left before the architecture was unified and the plans to do so weren't written down.
That's in limbo for now.

> [!NOTE]
> ToDo: Let's fill this out with an explanation of the directory structure as we decide how we want it to look.

## Hosting

The project is deployed to Azure as a static web app.
The dev environment is hosted at: [https://dev.tacticusplanner.app/](https://dev.tacticusplanner.app/)
The production environment is hosted at: [https://tacticusplanner.app/](https://tacticusplanner.app/)

## Conventions

- Use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling all new code
- Use [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) for data grids
- Use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for other components

## Significant Pain Points

This section lists known tech debt issues that we'd like to improve over time.

### Inconsistent Architecture

Right now the code is split between the FSD Architecture in the `src/fsd` directory and a different architecture in `src/v2`.
Of the two, the `src/v2` folder appears to be the older of the two.

There are also quite a few folders in `src` for more general concerns (e.g. `routes`, `services`, `reducers`, etc...).

This inconsistency makes it harder for people to jump in and contribute.

At some point we should decide on what we want to go with for future development and then migrate to a single architecture.

### Styling & Components

Right now there are multiple different competing styling solutions:

- Vanilla CSS
- Inline Styles
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling using atomic utility classes
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling using CSS-in-JS
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for a cleaner alternative syntax to regular CSS

There are also multiple different component libraries:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) that incorporates behaviour and a design system.
- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) for dataviz components
- [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) that are primarily behaviour (a.k.a. headless UI)
- [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-react) for icons
- [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) for data grids

We have listed the preferred options in the [conventions section](#conventions) but there's a fair amount of code that doesn't currently comply with them.
At some point we should start moving the older code to follow the current conventions.
This will make both the UI and the code more consistent.

### Expansive Code

There's a lot going on in this codebase.
A lot of that is just from how much the app offers.
Still, there's an opportunity to make a lot of it simpler using modern React tooling.

For example:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to combine compile-time type safety with run-time parsing & validation
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for async loading/error handling + localStorage persistence
- [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) to eliminate the need for `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo`

Please keep in mind that the value of trying to make something simpler depends heavily on what's going on in the project. Be sure to talk with the team to build consensus before implementing anything new or changing an existing pattern.
