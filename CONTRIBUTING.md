# Contributing

Please message on the [Discord#contribute Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1146809197023997972/1183885004850331788) to join the team.
We'll help you get started there but here are the most important bits.

## Project Planning

We use a combination of Discord and a Trello board for planning what's going on.
The Trello board is managed by Redwyne.

> [!NOTE]
> Longer term technical plans are being considered in the [Technical Roadmap](./TECH_ROADMAP.md).

## Project Status

`Severyn` originally created the project but has since stepped back for personal reasons.
Control was handed off to `cpunerd` (a.k.a. Kharnage, GitHub name _?_).

## Project Architecture

A lot of the project is built using [FSD Architecture - Feature Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/).
This is an architecture that splits code by feature and avoids having much cross boundaries between features.

Before leaving, `Severyn` started work on a v2 directory.
Unfortunately he left before that was completed and the plans were written down.
That's in limbo for now.

## Hosting

The project is deployed to Azure as a static web app.
The staging environment is hosted at: _url?_
The production environment is hosted at: [https://tacticusplanner.app/](https://tacticusplanner.app/)
