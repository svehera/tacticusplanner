# Calendar Images

Calendar images can be updated by pasting a new image into this folder, then setting the url for `current` or `next` season in `src/fsd/1-pages/home/desktop-home.tsx` accordingly.

These event calendar images are created by Snowprint staff (Tacticus developers) before each new battle pass season, and posted to the Tacticus Discord.

Old calendar images can be safely deleted from this folder once superseded.
