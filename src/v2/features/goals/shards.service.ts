     * - Determines which shards can be obtained from today's available raids, filtered by
     *   `settings.raidedLocations`.
     * - Sums up total and per-day energy requirements, total onslaught tokens, and total raids
     *   needed across all materials.
     * - Calculates the total number of days required to achieve all goals, taking the maximum of:
     *   - The longest individual material's days-to-completion estimate.
     *   - The number of days required to accumulate enough onslaught tokens, assuming a daily gain
     *     of 1.5 tokens (rounded up).
     *
     * Subtle behavior:
     * - The `daysTotal` is not simply the sum of days for each material, but the maximum of all
     *   individual requirements and the onslaught token constraint. This ensures the estimate
     *   reflects the true bottleneck.
     * - The function assumes that onslaught tokens are earned at a fixed rate (1.5 per day), which
     *   may not match actual in-game rates if bonuses or events apply.
     *
     * @param settings - User-defined settings affecting ascension and resource calculation.
     * @param goals - One or more character ascend or unlock goals to estimate for.
     * @returns An object summarizing all relevant shard acquisition estimates and requirements.
